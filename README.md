Structure of the dossier : 

1. **`db_connectors.py`**:
   - This script defines connectors for three types of database: Postgres, SQLite and MySQL.
   - Each connector provides functions for connecting to the database, executing SQL queries, obtaining the list of tables and retrieving the schema of a table.

2. **programm_formatters.py**:
   - This script defines classes to format the SQL results generated by the language model.
   - The `TableColumn` class represents a table column.
   - The `ForeignKey` class represents a foreign key.
   - The `Table` class represents a table with its columns, primary keys and foreign keys.
   - The `RajkumarFormatter` class formats the tables and SQL queries generated by the model.

3. **Database_Manager.py**:
   - This script defines the `DatabaseManager` class which acts as a central manager.
   - The manager is responsible for connecting to the database, initialising the language model, and executing the SQL queries generated by the model.

4. **Main.py**:
   - This script is the main entry point to your application.
   - It interacts with the user to obtain information about the database, creates a database manager, and then allows the user to ask questions in natural language to generate SQL queries.
